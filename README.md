# INTRODUCTION
## __Aim:__ 
To build an article recommedation system using word embedding (Doc2Vec) and Cosine similarity.

## __Dataset:__ 
The Medium article dataset from kaggle was used. The dataset contains title, text from articles, and other information about the article.


## __Models:__
__Doc2Vec:__  Doc2Vec is a word embedding technique that computes a feature vector for every document in the corpus unlike Word2vec which compute vector for every word. <br/>
__Cosine Similarities:__ Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure the similarity of two vectors. it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space.
